# Analog Clock Project

An interactive, browser-based analog clock created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project visually replicates the look and movement of a traditional analog clock using smooth CSS animations and JavaScript for real-time updates.

## Overview

This project showcases an analog clock that dynamically updates every second, simulating the movement of hour, minute, and second hands in real time. The clock is designed to be responsive and can be customized easily, making it an ideal learning project for front-end web development skills, such as CSS transforms and JavaScript timing functions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Uses JavaScript’s Date object to track the current time and move the clock hands in sync with real time.
- **Smooth Animation**: CSS transitions create smooth, realistic hand movements.
- **Responsive Design**: The clock scales well on various screen sizes.
- **Customizable**: Easily update colors, sizes, and styles in the CSS to personalize the clock.
